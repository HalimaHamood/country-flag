Last Project: Country Flag Quiz.

User Story:

Users see a page with a title and subtext that explains the quiz.
Below the subtext, they see a button that can be clicked so they can start the quiz.
When they click the button they move to another page and they see a flag and a number of radio buttons.
The flag is the flag of a random country and the radio buttons show 4 possible countries that the flag is for.
The user can select any one of the 4 choices (no multi-select, only one correct answer).
once the user selects the country name, they can click on a button to go to the next question.
There will be a total of 3 questions.
On question #3 the user sees a submit button.
Once they submit they get a message with their results,
If they got 3/3 right then the message should reflect that.
If they get 2/3 or 1/3 they will get a different message that asks them to keep practicing.
If they get 0/3 then they should get a different message (can be anything you want).
The final page should have a link that allows users to restart a new quiz.
